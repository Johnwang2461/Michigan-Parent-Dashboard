    "The parent dashboard is unfortunately fickle. It does not 'properly' utilize each school's building code. Instead, there is some sort of generated school location id combination that is not easily identifiable for an individual school. However, it appears that the district code [id] can be used to navigate the various parent dashboards. As such, Stage 1 systematically iterates through all district id's and scrapes all schools within the district. In particular, I collect the district_id, district_name, core_link [starting link for the district], school_level [e.g., Elementary], school_name, school grade [e.g., K-5], and the school_link. The school_link is the most important for progressing to the next stage. It contains the parent dashboard for that individual school- while it is unlikely that I will scrape this main parent dashboard (information should be available from public datasets), the \"School Services and Offerings\" is of interest for the next stage."

    "In Stage 3, I will conduct an overarching gathering phase of the various elements on the School Services and Offering Page. In particular, it is important to acknowledge that the different school offerings, although a similar overarching structure, may or may not have elements displayed. For example, an Elementary school should not offer Advanced Placement courses; we may see an overarching header of Advanced Placement but there would be nothing underneath. High schools, which may offer Advanced Placement courses, simply display the ones that they offer (e.g., Calculus AB). Any AP courses that are not offered will not be listed.\n",

I know there is a finite number of AP courses, so I could pursue various routes to address this problem. 1) I could try to simply list out all possible variations and see if the text is contained (e.g., AP STATS, AP Statistics, Statistics AP)-- I don't think I could ever truly capture the full variation. 2) I could simply collect everything and have an ever-expanding dataset and then simply manually clean this afterwards. I think this is the feasible approach. I can easily identify that AP Statistics and Statistics AP are the same thing and then subsequently move that data into the same column.\n",
