    "At this point, I have amanged to scrape the entire set of information from the parent dashboard in Michigan (in theory). This is great. Most elements do not really have to be cleaned apart from a systematic renaming of the columns. The most pertinent set of cleaning that needs to be done are Advanced Placement courses. Although Advanced Placement (along with Career Technical Education, International Baccalaureate, and Services for Students with Disabilities) courses are supplied from Michigan's Student Data System (MSDS) - as stated in the Parent Dashboard School Leader Presentation - they are one of the few options that can wildly vary in the format applied. For example, a school may reigster their AP Statistics course as AP Stat, Statistics AP, AP Statistics (A), AP Statistics (B), etc. These courses should be standardized so that the number of AP courses are not artifically inflated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concerns (in terms of standardization) for the other topics do not really exist. As seen in the Educational Entity Master (EEM) and Points of Pride (POP) document (https://www.michigan.gov/cepi/-/media/Project/Websites/cepi/EEM/eem-pop-instructional.pdf?rev=023d5137723c4df691eb3dda12212eef&hash=B697920F3EA0CEA1BBD38A56467C5D7C), authorized users are able to simply go through a series of 'yes or no' buttons for each offering and service ('What is your school's percentage of students in National Honor Society' is a drop down menu of 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, or 76% or more).\n",
